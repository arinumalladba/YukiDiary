                                <p>This is in April 2024 after we returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia and we got
                                    him a
                                    traditional garment to wear. We bought him the smallest size and although they
                                    aren't
                                    supposed to be worn by cats, we thought he would look adorable in one. He was such a
                                    good
                                    sport when wearing it and actually got quite comfortable in it too! Doesn't he look
                                    so
                                    cute!!</p>

                                <p>This was in January 2024. Yuki had just come back from the vet after being neutered.
                                    Yuki
                                    doesn't do too well being outdoors but he does enjoy watching the outside world as
                                    long
                                    as he has one of humans in plain site. In this picture, he is wearing his "cone of
                                    shame"
                                    but it only benefitted him as it stopped him from messing around with the surgical
                                    site
                                    (barely!). As you can see he wasn't too pleased about wearing it. Poor Yuki! </p>

                                <h3>Baby Yuki napping on top of his cat bed</h3>
                                <p>This was in September 2023. We bought Yuki quite a few beds and a huge cat tree for
                                    him
                                    to
                                    rest in but he found this particular cat bed to be his favourite. This cat bed is
                                    supposed to be one of those that have the bed inside of the overall structure.
                                    However,
                                    Yuki preffered to sleep on top of the structure instead of inside of it. He was
                                    really
                                    comfy sleeping on top of it as you can see by his funny pose! </p>
